## Code Structure üèóÔ∏è

The code is structured around a doubly linked list to store and manipulate lines of text efficiently. Below is an overview of the key components:

- **Node Structure**: Represents each line of text with pointers to the next and previous nodes.
- **TextEditor Class**: Encapsulates all the functionalities like adding, editing, deleting lines, displaying the text, saving to a file, reading from a file, and handling user commands.

### Installation and Compilation
To compile and run the text editor, you need a C++ compiler like `g++`. Use the following commands to compile and run the program:
```sh
g++ -o TextEditor TextEditor.cpp
./TextEditor
```

### Dependencies
This project uses the C++ standard library and the `<unistd.h>` library for sleep functionality.
